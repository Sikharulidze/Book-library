<h2 class="ejs3">MY NOTES</h2>

<p class="ejs4">Demons is the most Dostoyevskian of all Dostoyevsky books.

    If you measure the book by conventional writing standards then it's easily the worst of Dostoyevsky's major novels, because the plot is convoluted, unfocused, the narrator inconsistently switches between being an omniscient narrator and an unreliable narrator, and there are too many unnecessary characters.
    
    But if you measure the book by the amount of stuff that makes Dostoyevsky unique and great, then it is one of the best books. You get a darker athmosphere and more elaborate insane philosophizing than in his other books.</p>

<p class="ejs4"> The novel begins with the introduction of Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky and Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin, who are boldly depicted as friends until the very last pages. Nikolai Stavrogin, Varvara's son, is described by Dostoevsky as a “crude young man, corrupted and faithless.The youth are preparing for a revolution that will shake Russia. Pyotr Stepanovich, Stepan's son, is the main antagonist who manipulates and abuses those who cling to the “old” idea. He is convinced that he can bring Russia to ruin through violence and terror, described as a “mad nihilist.”The central character of the novel is Nikolai Stavrogin. A charismatic young man, his life is filled with immoral acts that wreak havoc on him until he decides to leave for St. Petersburg. At the same time, he wants to marry the crippled Marya Lebyadkina as a way to redeem himself. This desire, however, leads to many complications.</p>
<p class="ejs4"> Dostoevsky addresses both political and moral themes tied to Russian reality in the 19th century. Many critics see The Demons as a prediction of the Russian Revolution of 1917, though the book was written in 1872.</p>
<p class="ejs4">The novel is set in a small town, focusing on a group of revolutionaries, intellectuals, and residents who fiercely clash with the ideology that drives events, casting the “demons” into unstoppable rampages and mad actions.</p>
<p class="ejs4">Without a doubt. It's one of the darkest and most fascinating books I've encountered. It's Dostoevsky's most political work, based on real events, very relevant nowadays. 
    Can feel slow and convoluted at times, but once you immerse yourself, it's an incredibly intense, gripping and deeply intellectual experience. Some of Dostoevsky's most complex characters (and I'd say in fiction in general) are in this.The demon and the demons” are how I would describe all of us.</p>
<p class="ejs4">
    I really love Demons. It is different from other Dostoievsky's books because it is kind of sarcastic. I felt like he was laughing on rich russians who wanted to be French. And it is the most violent book of Dostoievsky. The characters are fascinating and deep.</p>
<p class="ejs4">This novel seem mainly about a precaution to liberal idealism, nihilism, and atheism ideas which some may claim to be prevailing ideas of modern society specially through a lens of a devout person growing up with social media/internet age. This book does have added significance in terms of the themes being topical. It may set apart a reader's understanding and approach towards modern society depending too on how well they separate and reconcile differences of personal experiences in conjunction to another person's dynamic introspection and perspectives expressed in this novel. It is worth for me for the characters and what they represent more than the novel structure. This book did have its moments that were particularly hilarious too like how when he would go on a diatribe about certain individuals or groups of people.</p>
<p class="ejs5">If you aren't prepared to invest sufficient time and energy to get an understanding of outstandingly complex charcters, or generally delve well beneath the book's more political surface, then it might not be worth it depending on the reader. The book isn't made for a light reading, and everything within in can only be properly understood within context of everything else, as it is when taken as a whole a biography of a character who is intentionally kept hidden from most of the surface plot. If you aren't prepared to digest it like an alligator digests a particularly large meal, then it's not the right time to eat/read it. If you do read it properly though, then the payoff could be immense.</p>
