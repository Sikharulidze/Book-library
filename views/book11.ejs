<h2 class="ejs3">MY NOTES</h2>

<p class="ejs4">The House of the Dead served to be an astonishing novel, which left me in extreme awe over the meticulously crafted gritty atmosphere, the in-depth profiling of human nature, and the several moral questions it left running through my mind.</p>

<p class="ejs4">The novel takes inspiration from when Dostoyevsky was sent to serve a four-year sentence of hard labour in a remote Siberian Prison, due to his part in the Petrashevsky Circle. Using this experience he crafted the story of Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov, the narrator exiled for murdering his wife, who takes us through the experience of his ten-year penal servitude. It is an account of fact, emotion, and philosophical ideas knit together by a theme.</p>
<p class="ejs4">Throughout the first part of the book, he crafts an authentic, beautifully horrifying image of the prison. From the cockroach soup, the small and cramped environments, and the general lack of hygiene. Through the almost soulless lens of the narrator, we can perceive how this horrific environment cruelly petrifies a man. Further, from Aleksanderâ€™s tone we can instantly perceive hatred and distaste for oneself, and this becomes exemplified as he is faced with humiliating torture from his fellow inmates for being of noble class. The writing has a drowsy flow, which instantly makes you connect with the distraught of the main character, and serves as one of the bridges transporting you to this grotesque world.</p>
<p class="ejs4">The second lesson is about the ability of the common man to educate. The prison is built mainly of peasants, and this is highlighted throughout the accounts Aleksandr presents for us. However, throughout the years, Aleksandr begins to realize that the common man holds great value. Coming from a noble background, the heavy influence of hierarchy shrouded this truth from him, but in reality these men are highly educated in their own ways. This is also made prominent to the reader, as he is taken through many accounts of the men. Each of their tales serve a crucial moral lesson, which connect to all the lives we live, no matter how diverse they are.</p>
<p class="ejs4">Every man holds value, wether inmate or not, the experiences of life are something we can all hold in common.</p>
<p class="ejs5">Finally, through all of this we start to view the humanity in all these prisoners. Desire, hope, sorrow, pain; these are all common emotions felt by every man. These prisoners are seen to hold things such as hobbies, aspirations, and in some stories we have a glimpse into their ability to love and lust. The entire books begins to make you ponder about such things as the the justness in the cruelty we inflict upon prisoners, and the systems we hold in place. The book served to me as a moral battleground, making me see more truth in the common attributes of man, and the world we live in. Though written centuries ago, the philosophical questions and ideas this novel holds apply to the world we live in today.</p>
