<h2 class="ejs3">MY NOTES</h2>

<p class="ejs4">Post-WWI Disillusionment  The novel captures the struggles of German veterans who return from World War I to a broken society. The war may be over, but its wounds—both physical and emotional—remain fresh.</p>

<p class="ejs4">Friendship as a Lifeline  The relationship between Robert, Otto, and Gottfried is the emotional core of the novel. Their unwavering support for each other in a world that offers little hope is deeply moving.</p>
<p class="ejs4">Love and Loss  The romance between Robert and Patricia is poignant and tragic. Patricia’s fragility and their doomed love story reflect the fleeting happiness that war survivors experience.</p>
<p class="ejs4">Political and Economic Chaos  The backdrop of Weimar Germany, with its hyperinflation, social unrest, and rise of extremism, adds depth to the novel. It portrays a society teetering on the edge of collapse.</p>
<p class="ejs4">Melancholy and Nostalgia  There’s a sense of inevitable loss throughout the book. The characters try to hold on to the past, but the world is changing too fast for them.</p>
<p class="ejs5">Three Comrades is a hauntingly beautiful novel about love, friendship, and survival in a world that no longer makes sense. It reminds us that while war destroys nations, its greatest impact is on human relationships and the fragile hope for a better future.</p>
