<h2 class="ejs3">MY NOTES</h2>

<p class="ejs4">The Allure of Freedom and Nature  The book explores the romanticized idea of leaving behind materialism and societal expectations to seek pure, unfiltered experiences in nature. Chris McCandless (a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp) embodies this desire, yet his journey highlights both the beauty and harshness of living off the grid.</p>
<p class="ejs4"> Idealism vs. Reality McCandless' story is both inspiring and cautionary. His belief that he could survive in the wild with minimal preparation reflects an idealistic mindset that clashes with the unforgiving reality of the Alaskan wilderness.</p>
<p class="ejs4"> Parental Conflict and Rebellion  His rejection of wealth and comfort stems from a strained relationship with his parents. This adds depth to his character—his journey wasn’t just about adventure, but also about finding meaning beyond family conflicts.</p>
<p class="ejs4">Isolation and Self-Discovery While solitude offers self-reflection, McCandless’ final days reveal the limitations of isolation. His realization that “happiness is only real when shared” suggests a shift in his perspective.</p>
<p class="ejs4">Krakauer’s Perspective The author blends McCandless’ story with his own experiences and those of other wanderers, creating a broader discussion about the human desire for adventure and escape.</p>
<p class="ejs4"></p>
<p class="ejs5">Into the Wild is a thought-provoking exploration of independence, adventure, and the limits of self-reliance. McCandless’ journey resonates with those who seek purpose beyond conventional life, yet his story serves as a reminder that nature, while beautiful, is indifferent to human dreams. His fate underscores the fine line between adventure and survival.</p>
